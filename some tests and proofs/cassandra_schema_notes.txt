Options for implementing HLL without read before write.

What I need:

I generally need something like grid / two dimentional array.

There will be 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 grid "X" coordinate and 256 (because 1 byte can store 0-255 as value) grid "Y" coordinate.

There will be no value, but I can store there "1" (because we use PHP and it requires some value),
we can also store the byte value, in order to read data easier.



Option 1:

One counter on one row:

Row key: counter name (my_counter)
Column names will be XXX:YYY.

Count calculation will requires reading of the full row (512 x 256)



Option 2:

One counter on 256 rows:

Row key: counter name : YYY (my_counter:123)
Column names will be XXX, could be Integer or String.

Count calculation will requires reading of the full 256 rows, and all columns.



Option 3:

One counter on 512 rows:

Row key: counter name : XXX (my_counter:444)
Columns names must be Integers, reversed comparator.

Because we need only max(id),
Count calculation will need to read only first column on each row, but there will be 512 rows.

something like:

multiget(range(512), ColumnSlice(limit = 1))



Project will be implemented in Python, but we definitely need to be able to read the data with PHP.
